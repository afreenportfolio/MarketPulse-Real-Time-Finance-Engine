## Phase 1: Data Pipeline
1. I stored the daily stock data in a JSON file (with proper formatting to prevent formatting errors) to optimize API usage.
2. Developed a Python script that iterates through nested timeseries data to extract key metrics (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

### Setup Instructions:
1. Run the Python script to fetch the key metrics through the nested timeseries
2. Your data pipeline is ready!
